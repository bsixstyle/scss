      <h3>The story</h3>
      <p>
        You need extra effort to make your website look better, call the classes
        or write a script that you need, it's quite boring and worthless if you
        have a another solutions, when you have a way to automate or scafold
        something for example you create crud operations, the code is generated
        by tool and then you modify the codes because its look ugly? of course
        it requires extra effort to add some classes and scripts, i feel boring
        with dats, LOL ... as a developer who is not concerned with cosmetics
        ... yes thats why the author created this, to minimiza efforts :). maybe
        this is one of the reasons why the author is unemployed and have no
        income LOL.

      <h3>Why basic?</h3>
      <p>
        Major components such as buttons, form, table, header etc...no need
        extra classes, it's only html standard.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Why Dark Mode?</h3>

        modes are trending. dark mode is save batery and does not make my eyes get tired more quickly.
